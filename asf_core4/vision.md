# Purpose and Orientation

This work is for reclaiming whole, integrated creative power. It centers safety as native and natural, honors sovereignty and freedom to be, and treats every part of the self as good and worthy of joy and abundance.

The opportunity cost of disownment and shame is massive. The affordance to unlock is the power and creativity of self-aware, self-loving people who lead from the heart and in partnership.

This system should be a permissive world where creation is whole and complete and reclaimed, where life is revered and sacred, and where one-size-fits-none artifacts are anachronistic.
